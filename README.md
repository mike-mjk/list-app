# To-Do List built with Firebase, TypeScript, Materialize, and React

Thanks for checking out the readme!

## What's cool about this?

### It's built with Firebase and TypeScript, which I had never used before this.

It was cool to work with TypeScript for the first time. The hardest part about working with TypeScript for this app was figuring out to assign the event argument in my Input component to React.SyntheticEvent<HTMLFormElement>.

### Attention to detail.

Obviously, this is just a simple To-Do List app, but there are a few design elements that make it nice to use.

1. Delete Icon shows up on hover only which provides the functionality you need without cluttering up the list as you read it.

2. The functionality of checking things off of the list without deleting them is nice to have.

3. For items that go beyond one line the checkbox stays vertically centered.

4. It is responsive for all device widths.
